Use deadcode optimization to check whether there is code that can be removed that doesn't contribute to the final outcome.

Step 1:
Run each optimization one by one.

Pull up whole list of flags -q. Make a list of all the flags, record the time for each run with each optimization.
Also, run with default and level optimizations.

1.05 speedup is what we are going to consider.

Step 2:
Using the data from the run with each individual optimization. Look at optimizations and pull the best 3-5 flags to analyze.
Possibly mix and match optimization levels with flags.
Mix and match the best flags to look at performance.
